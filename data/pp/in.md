<p>Professional  Experience  (Latest Relevant)<br />
► Layer Delivery Leader – Senior Scrum Master  – EY CT – Jul 2023 – Present :<br />
As EY's AI Portfolio Delivery Coordinator, I spearhead Agile transformation. Working with 20 
Scrum Masters and 4 Release Train Engineers, I've elevated our Agile maturity score from 2 
to 3.5 (approaching market -ready level). This transformation fueled one of the biggest 
launches in con sulting history – EYQ, our internal ChatGPT.  </p>
<p>My impact is measurable:<br />
Accelerated Version 1.0 implementation to just 4 weeks.<br />
On-time major releases achieved by combining Scrum development with a waterfall 
approach for change management.<br />
Delivery ratio boosted from 80% to 95%, with sustainable cadence and high team 
retention.<br />
My approach? I champion Agile practices based on SAFe and Scrum, enhanced with 
strategic EY customizations. I'm not just a framework expert; I drive results that transform 
businesses.  </p>
<p>► Release Train Engineer – Senior Scrum Master - EY CT – Jul 2022 – Jun 2023 :<br />
As Agile Release Train leader for EY's Cloud Portfolio, I streamlined delivery for 11 Scrum 
Masters and 8 Cybersecurity Products. I implemented a robust Release Process 
Management system, boosting transparency and stakeholder confidence.  My custom 
tracking tool (built with GitHub, Azure DevOps, and PowerBI) empowered Scrum Masters 
and Product Managers, enabling them to refine their practice and optimize feature 
trade -offs. </p>
<p>The result? We doubled feature releases, delivering consistent value to stakeholders. My 
expertise lies in translating Agile methodologies into real -world improvements and team 
growth.  </p>
<p>► Senior Scrum Master – EY CT – Jul 2021 to Jul 2022:  <br />
I served as Scrum Master for 2 pods in a key EY cybersecurity product. Starting with 4 small 
pods, I helped launch the MVP in just 3 months, securing 2 years of funding and doubling 
team size. Meticulous team -building (front/backend devs, UX, etc.) fueled rapid growth.  </p>
<p>My results speak for themselves: 2 major releases achieved. This success led to my 
promotion as Release Train Engineer, managing the cadence of 8 cybersecurity products 
within a single Agile Release Train.  I excel at both hands -on Scrum leadership and 
strategic scaling for complex delivery.<br />
I was also acting temporary as Business Analyst  for the Frontend Team.  </p>
<p>► Data and Digital Officer - ENGIE  – Jul 2019 to Jun 2021: <br />
I served as a subject matter expert in data science and IoT, guiding regional offices and 
subsidiaries on their data transformation journey. I helped them adopt data technologies 
and implement the first four key data -driven and Scrum A gile process es, acting as a 
catalyst for their shift to a data -driven organization.  </p>
<p>Beyond strategy, I wore multiple hats: Technical Product Manager, Product Owner, and 
Scrum Master. Leading various digital products, I ensured smooth execution and 
delivered value to stakeholders.  </p>
<p>► Technology Manager - ENGIE  – Oct 2014 to Jul 2019:<br />
Partnered with LATAM regional office &amp; subsidiaries to execute a seamless cloud 
migration (to Microsoft Office 365) and provide infrastructure support.  This migration 
served 14 offices, in 7 countries, with 10k users. The biggest transition to cloud in the 
company.  Pedro  Ciancaglini<br />

Behavioral research suggests that the most effective people are those who understand
themselves, both their strengths and weaknesses, so they can develop strategies to
meet the demands of their environment.
A person's behavior is a necessary and integral part of who they are.  In other words, much of
our behavior comes from "nature" (inherent), and much comes from "nurture" (our upbringing).
It is the universal language of "how we act," or our observable human behavior.
In this report we are measuring four dimensions of normal behavior.  They are:
How you respond to problems and challenges.
How you influence others to your point of view.
How you respond to the pace of the environment.
How you respond to rules and procedures set by others.
This report analyzes behavioral style; that is, a person's manner of doing things.  Is the report
100% true?  Yes, no and maybe.  We are only measuring behavior.  We only report
statements from areas of behavior in which tendencies are shown.  To improve accuracy, feel
free to make notes or edit the report regarding any statement from the report that may or may
not apply, but only after checking with friends or colleagues to see if they agree.

Based on Pedro's responses, the report has selected general statements to
provide a broad understanding of his work style.  These statements identify the
basic natural behavior that he brings to the job.  That is, if left on his own, these
statements identify HOW HE WOULD CHOOSE TO DO THE JOB.  Use the
general characteristics to gain a better understanding of Pedro's natural behavior.
Pedro is approachable, affectionate and understanding.  He tends to trust
people and may be taken advantage of because of his high trust level.  He
projects a self-assured and self-confident image.  He is most likely to be at
his best in situations where important things, such as values, judgments,
feelings and emotions are involved.  He prides himself on his "intuition."
Pedro wants to be seen as his own person, but usually projects it in friendly
terms.  He likes feedback from his manager on how he is doing.  He
influences most people with his warmth.  He tries to influence others
through a personal relationship and many times will perform services to
develop this relationship.  Pedro is good at creating enthusiasm in others.
He prefers working for a participative manager.  He does his best work in
this kind of environment.
Pedro likes working for managers who make quick decisions.  He is good at
solving problems that deal with people.  He is good at giving verbal and
nonverbal feedback that serves to encourage people to be open, to trust
him and to see him as receptive and helpful.  He prefers not disciplining
people.  He may sidestep direct disciplinary action because he wants to
maintain the friendly relationship.  Pedro likes to participate in decision
making.  When he has strong feelings about a particular problem, you
should expect to hear these feelings, and they will probably be expressed in
an emotional manner.  Because of his trust and willing acceptance of
people, he may misjudge the abilities of others.
